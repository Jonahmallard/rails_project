# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#Faker

# 1000.times do
#     Drive.create()
# end

#at a minimum
# create one driver

# create 3-5 cars

# 10.times do
#     car = Car.all.sample
#     drive = Drive.first
#     placement = rand(1..15)
#     Race.create(car_id: car.id, drive_id: drive.id, location: "race track", placement: placement)
    
# end
